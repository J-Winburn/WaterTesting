# WaterTesting
This is the code that is used to operate my teams water testing machine in my EGR215 course. Vision system code is written by me, and arm control as well as pipette control was implemented through this code as well. 

The image below was the contraints met in this project as well as the grading criteria, in which my team was able to achieve 220/200
